# .Net Core Pagination Example

This is a test driven implementation of Searching, Filtering, Ordering and Pagination. I wrote it because there was a discussion about  pagination libraries on an online forum. So I wrote this to highlight how easy it is to roll your own.

Technologies / practices:
* Test Driven Development
* .Net 6.0
* Entity Framework Core 6.0
* Entity Framework InMemory Database 6.0
* MSTest
